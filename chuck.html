	<p>The spritely footsteps indicate it is Spiderman even before I see the silhouette of his tiny masked head outlined on my door. He bursts in without knocking-- very unprofessional.</p><p>
“Rhino at the casino. I need your best work, Chuck. Now!”</p><p>
“Best work?” As if I ever did anything but my best work. “Okay.”</p><p>
“Come on!”</p><p>
“Can’t rush genius, kid.” He is the worst of them. At least the older superheroes have some patience. I grin. “You shoulda kept running, ‘cause your luck just ran out.”</p><p>
“Perfect!” He drops a twenty on my desk and runs out.</p><p>
I hate my job.</p><p><br>

The End</p>
