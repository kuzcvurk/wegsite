	<p>My day job (the one that actually makes me money) is as an electrical engineer. Day to day, I write programs, design embedded systems, run field tests and such. Sometimes I have to purchase equipment from companies. I recently had a rather pleasant and lengthy email exchange with one such company, when I purchased one of their boards and had to exchange it for another (my own fault, not theirs). While nailing down the details for the exchange, their lovely salesperson mentioned finding a book called "The Sphere" on Amazon, and wondered if I was the same Michelle McBeth. Indeed I was! They were very excited by the summary of it, and downloaded it that very day.</p><p>
	I found the whole thing exciting and just a little unsettling. I consider my book to be part of my personal life, and I tend to keep my personal life rather separate from my work. It's part of the reason no coworker has ever seen me in a play, and probably never will. It's also why I haven't talked about my book much at work. Very few people at this point even know about it. It's the opposite of good marketing tactics.</p><p>
	I assume this hesitation on my part has to do with a desire to keep a professional impression of myself upon the people I work with. I've always been very reserved with my emotions, and acting and writing this book definitely breech that boundary. The book a little less so than acting. My father recently commented that he couldn't read my book without picturing me as Adelaide. It makes sense, since the character is slightly autobiographical. Then I realized it's a good thing my sister Heather's book is geared towards teens. I can't imagine what my father would think reading the end of "The Ghost in my Bedroom" and picturing her. The end of the book was disturbing and upsetting. Frankly, I cried, because I couldn't help not picturing my sister. In that sense, I think she is incredibly brave in her story choices.</p><p>
	The idea of one day being famous terrifies me. It's strange, since I'm perfectly comfortable performing in front of people (normal stage jitters aside). In grad school I became very adept at giving presentations on my research, and know how to work a room very well. But in both of these situations, it's not me. It's my work personae. It's the character I'm playing.</p><p>
		And it's exhausting.
