    <richText>Every year for the past 10-ish years my sisters and I have gotten together before Christmas and made some gingerbread creation. In the past we&#x2019;ve done everything from standard houses to a pirate ship. This year, due to lack of time, we decided to do a fairy tree house. Our reasoning being that it wouldn&#x2019;t need to be perfect (in fact, the more oddly shaped the better), and we wouldn&#x2019;t have to spend a lot of time planning structure and cutting out patterns and such. We took two metal bowls, wrapped them in foil and parchment and smushed on a bunch of gingerbread, wrapping it one more time in parchment to help keep it from sagging too much around the bottom. &#xD;&#xD;The mold worked quite well and although the top of the tree trunk burned a little, the shape came out very well. Once finished, we cut some holes for balconies and doors, then got straight to decorating. The other advantage to this design is no long time waiting for walls to harden. My nephews helped too (sort of). &#xD;&#xD;We had a few people think it was a volcano (green lava? really?) but most got the idea that it was supposed to be a tree. And really, we&#x2019;re not trying to win contests here, we just want excuses to eat a lot of candy and get sick. Enjoy some photos from this year and past that I was able to scrounge up...&#xD;&#xD;&lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/25E9FF75-4D02-408A-A9C7-27AE9E3457AC"&gt;Gingerbread Photos&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;</richText>
