    <richText>Yesterday was the Gaithersburg Book Festival. I was really pleased to get a spot again this year since it went so well for me last year. Even with the horrid weather and an infant in tow, it was a good time. I met some very nice people and got a few questions that really challenged me. I also have to thank my mother-in-law (back there with Sheffield) for helping out yesterday, and my husband (taking the selfie) for his awesome sales work. Though the tactic of yelling &#x201C;Time Travel&#x201D; at people walking by seemed to startle them more than get them to stop at the table.&#xD;&#xD;On the right there is the concept of the cover for book number 3 in The Sphere Saga, tentatively titled &#x201C;The Lunar Conspiracy&#x201D;. Since so many people purchased copies of my books yesterday, I&#x2019;m going to extend the character name contest out a few more months. So if you read one of my books and &lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/002FF14A-F160-4141-9735-200733D48359"&gt;write a review&lt;/a&gt; before September, let me know!&#xD;</richText>
