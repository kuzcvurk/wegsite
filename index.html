<p>
I started writing on a bet. A month later I had a rough draft of a book, and my award of $100. I never thought that would lead to three more books, but here I am. It's a nice change from my day job as an electrical and computer engineer.</p><p>In the small amount of free time I have after taking care of my kids, I also like to dabble in the kitchen, act, and narrate. After 3 long years as President, I am now on the board of directors for the <a href = https://northernvirginiawriters.org/>Northern Virginia Writers Club</a> and can be found at Northern Virginia area craft and book fairs.
    <p>You can preorder a <i>signed copy</i> of the fourth and final book of my time travel series, The Shape Of Time, during my <a href = https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mamcbeth/the-sphere-saga-the-shape-of-time>kickstarter</a>. Check out the fun video my family helped me make, including a bunch of time travel references; some obvious, some very subtle.</p>
