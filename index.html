                I started writing on a bet. A month later I had a rough draft of a book, and my award of $100. Never thought that would lead to four more books, but here I am. It's a nice change from my day job as an electrical and computer engineer.</p><p>In the small amount of free time I have after taking care of my kids, I also like to dabble in the kitchen, act, and narrate. I am the President for the <a href = https://northernvirginiawriters.org/>Northern Virginia Writers Club</a>, and also serve on the Board of Governors for the <a href = "https://www.virginiawritersclub.org/">Virginia Writers Club</a>.
